Interface

* Cannot be instantiated.
* Can be implemented by classes adn extended by other interfaces.
* Any class that implements an interface must implement all of its methods, or it must declare itself abstract.
* By default, methods in an interface are public adn abstract.
* In addition to abstract methods, interfaces may also contact default adn static methods as well.
